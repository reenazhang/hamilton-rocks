# Hamilton Data
This repo contains the code for our Hamilton web scraping / data wrangling project.

## Timeline
Entire project is 6 weeks (July 12th - August 23rd)

### 1. Webscraping
Obtain dataset by July 26th (2 weeks) -- use twitter API.
We will scrape Twitter users' reactions to Hamilton from its release in 2016 and its re-release in 2020. 

By Wednesday 7/22
- find solution to scrape tweet replies to @HamiltonMusical from 2014 to now
- scrape tweets from #HamiltonMusical 
- ideally find way to scrape from one time frame to another

### 2. Data Wrangling
Complete cleaning data / all wrangling by August 9th (2 weeks)
### 3. Data Visualization
Complete all visualizations (matplotlib / any other we want to learn) by August 23rd (2 weeks)
### 4. Machine Learning (if time)
Hopefully by this time, we will both have an ample understanding of ML algorithms and techniques.
